# Hello World!

So I finally got around to setting this blog thing up. Only took me several years, sorry not sorry.

Anyway, a little about me:

- I live in the UK, specifically in Nottingham.
- I work as a backend engineer (Spring microservices), although I've done a variety of other things in the past.
- I love tech, photography, going to meetups and travelling. Expect many posts on these topics! (If I don't forget, whoops)

## Why am I doing this?

I've always wanted an outlet for documenting the little nuggets of knowledge and information that I come across in my day to day job. I wrote a couple of posts on Medium that I put a decent amount of effort into, and I'll probably port those over if I remember to. While Medium didn't work out for me (I couldn't get along with their almost-forced paywall, amongst other things) I found writing about the things I do and love doing was very enjoyable to me.

On a somewhat related note, I'd like to leave a shout-out to Jamie Tanna for finally pushing me to start blogging again. He runs a local chapter of the [Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club) in Nottingham, and he has inspired not only me but several other people to kick off their blogs. [He runs a blog on similar subjects to mine](https://jvt.me), and it is definitely worth a read!

If you're interested, [you can follow me on Twitter @monotron_](https://twitter.com/monotron_). I post quite frequently there, and often live-tweet the meetups I go to. If you see me at the local meetups in Nottingham, don't be afraid to say hi! I'm always looking to meet new people in the tech space here.

Now to commit this post to GitHub and cross my fingers that the deploy doesn't break. ü§ûüèº
